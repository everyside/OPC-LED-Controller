# OPC-LED-Controller
LED pixel controller with mobile interface for playback of recorded OPC fadecandy files. Runs on node.js.

# What exactly is OPC-LED-Controller
This piece of software will allow you to playback previously recorded OPC (Open-Pixel-Control) animations on a local or remote fadecandy server. A separately distributed script is required to capture animation data output sent from your Processing(.org) client to the fadecandy server and save the OPC LED data stream in a local file. This way you can prepare and record various LED animations and store the raw data output sent to the fadecandy server for later playback by OPC-LED-Controller.
In the mobile optimized webinterface, OPC video files can be organized in playlists for playback at a specified time.

# What is required to play with OPC-LED-Controller

Lots of Neopixel stripes (or compatible) connected to fadecandy USB adapter(s), a fadecandy server installed on a raspberry server or any other linux device, and node.js to run OPC-LED-Controller. 

More documentation will follow.
